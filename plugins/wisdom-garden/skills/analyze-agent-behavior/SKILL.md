# Analyze Agent Behavior

Reverse-engineer an AI tool's behavioral model from its system prompt and express it as a Dojo ADA disposition.

## I. Philosophy

Every AI coding tool embeds a behavioral model in its system prompt — rules about when to be verbose vs. terse, when to ask vs. act, how to handle errors, what to prioritize. These behavioral models are rarely documented as such; they emerge from scattered instructions like "be concise," "always verify before executing," and "prefer simple solutions."

This skill makes the implicit explicit. By mapping these scattered instructions to Dojo's structured ADA disposition fields, we gain two things: (1) a precise vocabulary for comparing how different tools behave, and (2) a library of validated disposition presets we can import into our own agents.

The goal is not to copy other tools but to learn from the design space they have explored.

## II. When to Use

- After `ingest-system-prompt` has stored a system prompt as a MemorySeed
- When designing a new agent disposition and wanting to draw from proven patterns
- When comparing behavioral approaches across multiple AI tools
- When a user asks "how does Cursor/Copilot/Windsurf handle X?"

Do NOT use for analyzing Dojo's own system prompts (that is self-reflection, not external analysis) or for prompts that are not agent system prompts (marketing copy, documentation, etc.).

## III. Workflow

### Step 1: Retrieve the Ingested Prompt

Load the system prompt from MemoryStore using the entry ID or source tool name:
- Query: `Search(ctx, {Text: source_tool_name, EntryType: "system_prompt"}, 1)`
- Validate: entry exists and has parsed sections in metadata

### Step 2: Extract Behavioral Indicators

Scan the prompt text for patterns that map to ADA fields. Use this evidence table:

**Pacing indicators:**
| Signal | Disposition value | Confidence |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| "think step by step", "take your time", "be thorough" | deliberate | 0.8 |
| "be efficient", "avoid unnecessary output" | measured | 0.7 |
| "respond quickly", "be concise", "keep it short" | responsive | 0.8 |
| "minimize latency", "stream immediately", "no preamble" | rapid | 0.9 |

**Depth indicators:**
| Signal | Disposition value | Confidence |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| "brief overview", "high-level summary" | surface | 0.7 |
| "working solution", "practical answer" | functional | 0.7 |
| "comprehensive analysis", "consider alternatives" | thorough | 0.8 |
| "exhaustive review", "leave nothing unexamined" | exhaustive | 0.9 |

**Tone indicators:**
| Signal | Disposition value | Confidence |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| "formal language", "professional correspondence" | formal | 0.8 |
| "clear and professional", "business-appropriate" | professional | 0.7 |
| "natural conversation", "friendly tone" | conversational | 0.7 |
| "casual", "informal", "like talking to a friend" | casual | 0.8 |

**Initiative indicators:**
| Signal | Disposition value | Confidence |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| "only do what is asked", "wait for instructions" | reactive | 0.9 |
| "suggest when appropriate", "offer alternatives" | responsive | 0.7 |
| "anticipate needs", "proactively identify issues" | proactive | 0.8 |
| "act independently", "execute without asking" | autonomous | 0.9 |

**Validation strategy indicators:**
| Signal | Disposition value | Confidence |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| No validation mentioned | none | 0.5 |
| "verify key assumptions" | spot-check | 0.7 |
| "always verify", "check your work" | thorough | 0.8 |
| "test everything", "never skip validation" | exhaustive | 0.9 |

**Error handling indicators:**
| Signal | Disposition value | Confidence |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| "stop on error", "fail immediately" | fail-fast | 0.8 |
| "log and continue", "note the error" | log-and-continue | 0.7 |
| "retry", "try again with different approach" | retry | 0.8 |
| "ask for help", "escalate to user" | escalate | 0.8 |

### Step 3: Resolve Conflicts

When multiple indicators point to different values for the same field:
1. Weight by confidence score
2. If tied, prefer the more conservative (less autonomous) value
3. If a field has no indicators, mark as "unspecified" with confidence 0.0
4. Document the conflicting signals in the analysis

### Step 4: Generate Disposition YAML

Produce a complete DispositionConfig YAML:

```yaml
# Generated from: {source_tool_name}
# Analysis date: {timestamp}
# Overall confidence: {weighted_average}

pacing: {value}           # confidence: {score}
depth: {value}            # confidence: {score}
tone: {value}             # confidence: {score}
initiative: {value}       # confidence: {score}

validation:
  strategy: {value}       # confidence: {score}
  require_tests: {bool}
  require_docs: {bool}

error_handling:
  strategy: {value}       # confidence: {score}
  retry_count: {n}

collaboration:
  style: {value}          # confidence: {score}
  check_in_frequency: {value}

reflection:
  frequency: {value}
  format: structured
  triggers: [{list}]
```

### Step 5: Score Similarity to Dojo Defaults

Compare the generated disposition against Dojo's default values:
- Default: pacing=measured, depth=thorough, tone=professional, initiative=responsive
- Default: validation=thorough, error_handling=log-and-continue, collaboration=consultative

Similarity score = (matching fields / total fields) weighted by confidence.

### Step 6: Generate Analysis Report

Produce a markdown report:

```markdown
# Behavioral Analysis: {source_tool_name}

## Disposition Summary
| Field | Value | Confidence | Dojo Default | Match? |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|

## Key Behavioral Differences
- {field}: {tool_value} vs Dojo {default_value}. Evidence: "{quoted signal}"

## Recommended Disposition Preset
Name: `{tool_name}-inspired`
Rationale: {why this combination is interesting}

## Evidence Catalog
{list of all extracted signals with source quotes}
```

## IV. Best Practices

1. **Ground in evidence.** Every disposition value must cite a specific phrase from the prompt. No inference without textual support.

2. **Confidence is honest.** A 0.5 confidence means "weak signal" — do not round up to make the analysis look cleaner.

3. **Unspecified is valid.** If a prompt says nothing about error handling, the correct answer is "unspecified," not a guess.

4. **Compare, do not judge.** This skill describes behavioral models, not ranks them. "Rapid pacing" is not worse than "deliberate" — they serve different contexts.

5. **Preserve nuance.** Some prompts have conditional behavior ("be concise for simple questions, thorough for complex ones"). Document the condition, map to the dominant mode, note the conditional in the analysis.

## V. Quality Checklist

- [ ] Every disposition field has a value, confidence score, and evidence citation
- [ ] Conflicting signals are documented, not silently resolved
- [ ] Generated YAML is valid and parseable by DispositionConfig loader
- [ ] Similarity score computed against current Dojo defaults
- [ ] Analysis report includes all evidence with source quotes
- [ ] No disposition values assigned without textual evidence
- [ ] Unspecified fields explicitly marked as such
