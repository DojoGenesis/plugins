# File Management & Organization Skill

## I. Recommended Patterns

These are flexible patterns that can be adapted to different environments.

### 1. The Generic Web Application

This is a good starting point for many web applications.

```
/
├── public/             # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
├── src/                # Source code
│   ├── api/            # Backend API handlers/controllers
│   ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
│   ├── lib/            # Shared libraries, utilities, and helpers
│   ├── pages/          # Page-level components (if using a framework like Next.js)
│   ├── services/       # Business logic and external API clients
│   └── styles/         # Global styles
├── tests/              # Tests
├── .env                # Environment variables
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

### 2. The AROMA-style Contemplative Repository

This pattern is optimized for knowledge bases and contemplative practice repositories.

```
/
├── seeds/              # Reusable patterns of thinking
├── thinking/           # Philosophical reflections and insights
├── conversations/      # Summaries of key discussions
├── docs/               # Formal documentation (specifications, retrospectives)
├── SKILLS/             # Reusable workflow skills
├── prompts/            # Prompts for other agents (e.g., implementation agents)
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

### 3. The Go Backend Service

A common structure for a Go backend service.

```
/
├── cmd/                # Main application entry points
│   └── api/            # The main API server
├── internal/           # Private application and library code
│   ├── handlers/       # HTTP request handlers
│   ├── models/         # Database models
│   └── store/          # Database access layer
├── pkg/                # Public library code (if any)
├── .gitignore
├── go.mod
└── README.md
```

---

## II. Naming Conventions

Apply one of these consistently across the project:

- **kebab-case** (`my-component.js`) — preferred for web projects and knowledge bases
- **snake_case** (`my_component.py`) — preferred for Python and data projects
- **PascalCase** (`MyComponent.tsx`) — reserved for class files and React components only; do not apply to directories

**Temporal prefix pattern** — prefix dated artifacts with `YYYY-MM-DD_` so they sort chronologically without a separate timestamp field:

```
docs/
├── 2026-01-15_architecture-decision.md
├── 2026-03-02_retrospective.md
└── 2026-04-07_migration-plan.md
```

**Numbered directory pattern** — prefix ordered sequences with two-digit numbers so directory listing reflects intended execution order:

```
phases/
├── 01_discovery/
├── 02_design/
└── 03_implementation/
```

**Pointer README pattern** — place a short `README.md` at the root of any directory with 5+ subdirectories. The README names each subdirectory's purpose in one line. This is the only README that belongs in a skill-adjacent directory; it is navigation, not documentation.

## Output

-   A directory layout diagram (tree format) showing the proposed structure with inline comments explaining each directory's purpose
-   A naming convention decision (kebab-case, snake_case, or PascalCase) with the rationale for the choice
-   Optional: a short prose summary of the organizational philosophy for inclusion in the project's README or ARCHITECTURE.md

## Examples

**Scenario 1:** "I'm starting a new Next.js app, how should I organize it?" → Produce the Generic Web Application layout from Section I, adapted with a `pages/` directory and a `hooks/` directory under `src/`, plus a recommendation to use kebab-case for file names.

**Before (disorganized):**
```
/
├── index.js
├── helpers.js
├── UserForm.js
├── api_client.js
├── styles.css
└── tests.js
```

**After (organized):**
```
/
├── src/
│   ├── components/   # Reusable UI — UserForm.js
│   ├── lib/          # Shared utilities — helpers.js, api_client.js
│   └── styles/       # Global styles — styles.css
├── tests/            # All test files — tests.js
└── index.js          # Entry point only
```

**Scenario 2:** "Help me restructure this knowledge base — we have seeds, retrospectives, and skill files all mixed in one folder" → Produce the AROMA-style pattern, map the existing files to the new directories, apply temporal prefix to dated docs, and add a pointer README at the root.

**Before (mixed):**
```
/
├── skill-creation.md
├── retro-jan.md
├── retro-march.md
├── seed-focus-theorem.md
└── architecture-notes.md
```

**After (structured with temporal prefixes and pointer README):**
```
/
├── README.md                          # Pointer: one line per subdirectory
├── skills/
│   └── skill-creation/SKILL.md
├── seeds/
│   └── seed-focus-theorem.md
└── docs/
    ├── 2026-01-10_retrospective.md
    ├── 2026-03-15_retrospective.md
    └── 2026-04-01_architecture-notes.md
```

## Edge Cases

-   **Existing project with inconsistent but functional structure:** Do not impose a full reorganization unless the user explicitly asks for one. Instead, identify the 1–2 most disruptive inconsistencies and propose targeted fixes only.
-   **Project type not covered by the three patterns:** Ask one clarifying question about the dominant access pattern (e.g., "is this primarily read by humans or by code?") and adapt the closest matching pattern.
-   **Monorepo with multiple services:** Apply the Go Backend or Web Application pattern per service; add a top-level `services/` or `apps/` directory rather than flattening everything.

## Anti-Patterns

-   **Imposing structure before understanding the project:** Recommending a layout without first knowing the tech stack and team size produces a structure that fits the pattern, not the project.
-   **Nesting by file type instead of feature:** Grouping all controllers in one directory and all models in another couples unrelated features and makes feature-level changes harder to scope.
-   **Reorganizing a working project unprompted:** If the user asked for a new feature, not a file audit, applying this skill without invitation adds risk and context-switch cost.
