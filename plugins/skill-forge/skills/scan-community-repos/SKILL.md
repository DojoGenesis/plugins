# Scan Community Repos

## I. Workflow

### Step 1: Accept and Validate Inputs

Accept input as:

- One or more GitHub repository URLs: `https://github.com/owner/repo`
- One or more local directory paths: `/path/to/plugin-directory`
- A mixed list of both

For each GitHub URL, confirm the repository is accessible. If the URL requires authentication or returns 404, log it as inaccessible and skip — do not abort the full scan.

For each local path, confirm the directory exists. If it does not, log and skip.

**Output of this step:** A validated input list with accessibility status for each source.

### Step 2: Acquire Skill Files from Each Source

**For GitHub URLs:**

Clone each repository to a temporary directory:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 <repo-url> /tmp/skill-scan/<repo-name>
```

Use `--depth=1` to avoid fetching full history. If `git clone` fails (network issue, private repo), log the error and skip the source.

**For local paths:**

Walk the directory tree in place. No copy needed.

**Finding skill files:**

Within each acquired source, find candidate skill files using two passes:

1. **Exact match:** files named exactly `SKILL.md` (case-sensitive)
2. **Pattern match:** any `.md` file that contains a YAML frontmatter block (`---`) and whose path contains `skill` in the directory name or filename

For pattern-match candidates, apply a quick filter: the frontmatter must contain at least one of `name:` or `description:` to be considered a skill candidate. Discard files that pass the filename heuristic but have no frontmatter at all (these are likely documentation, not skills).

**Output of this step:** A flat list of candidate file paths per source repo.

### Step 3: Parse Each Candidate File

For each candidate file, parse:

1. **Frontmatter extraction:** Read lines between the first and second `---` delimiters. Parse as YAML.
2. **Body extraction:** All content after the second `---`.
3. **Handle parse errors:** If the YAML is malformed, classify the file as "incompatible" with reason "malformed frontmatter" and continue.

Extract these fields from the parsed frontmatter:

| Field | Check |
|---|---|
| `name` | Present and non-empty string |
| `description` | Present and non-empty string |
| Trigger phrases | Inline in description (`Trigger phrases?: (.+)`) or explicit `triggers:` key |
| `tier` | Present and integer 1–4 |
| `agents` | Present and non-empty array |
| `tool_dependencies` | Present (empty array is valid) |

Extract these structural signals from the body:

| Signal | Check |
|---|---|
| Philosophy section | Contains `## I.` or `## Philosophy` or `# Philosophy` |
| Workflow section | Contains `## III.` or `## Workflow` or `# Workflow` |
| Quality Checklist | Contains `## V.` or `Checklist` or `- [ ]` items |

### Step 4: Classify Each Skill

Apply the classification rules in order. Stop at the first matching rule.

**"ready"** — Passes SkillRegistry.IsValid():
- `name` present and non-empty
- `description` present and non-empty
- At least one trigger phrase (inline or extracted)
- `tier` present, integer 1–4
- `agents` non-empty array
- `tool_dependencies` present (can be empty array)

**"normalizable"** — Has the minimum required content but is missing Dojo-specific fields:
- `name` present and non-empty
- `description` present and non-empty
- Missing one or more of: triggers, tier, agents, tool_dependencies

**"incompatible"** — Cannot be normalized without manual repair:
- Missing `name` or `description`
- Frontmatter is malformed YAML
- File contains frontmatter delimiter but no actual YAML fields
- File matched the pattern heuristic but contains no frontmatter at all

### Step 5: Generate the Markdown Report

Write a markdown report to the output path (default: `./skill-scan-report.md`).

Report structure:

```markdown
# Skill Compatibility Scan Report

**Date:** <ISO 8601>
**Sources scanned:** <N>
**Total skills found:** <N>

## Summary

| Classification | Count | Percentage |
|---|---|---|
| ready | N | % |
| normalizable | N | % |
| incompatible | N | % |

## Skills Inventory

| Skill Name | Source Repo | Classification | Missing Fields | Body Structure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| skill-name | owner/repo | ready | — | Philosophy, Workflow, Checklist |
| another-skill | owner/repo | normalizable | tier, agents, triggers | Philosophy, Workflow |
| broken-skill | owner/repo | incompatible | name, description | unknown |

## Recommendations

### Ready for Import (N skills)
These skills can be registered immediately with no changes required.
<list of skill names>

### Batch Normalization Candidates (N skills)
Run `batch-normalize-and-package` on these skills. Each requires frontmatter enrichment only — the knowledge content is intact.
<list of skill names with missing field counts>

### Manual Repair Required (N skills)
These skills cannot be automatically normalized. Review each individually.
<list of skill names with incompatibility reason>

## Source Accessibility Log
<any skipped sources and their error messages>
```

### Step 6: Generate the JSON Catalog

Write a machine-readable catalog to `./skill-scan-catalog.json` alongside the markdown report.

JSON schema:

```json
{
  "scan_date": "<ISO 8601>",
  "sources": [
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo",
      "accessible": true,
      "skills_found": 12
    }
  ],
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "skill-name",
      "source_repo": "owner/repo",
      "source_path": "skills/skill-name/SKILL.md",
      "classification": "ready | normalizable | incompatible",
      "missing_fields": ["tier", "agents"],
      "has_triggers": true,
      "body_has_philosophy": true,
      "body_has_workflow": true,
      "body_has_checklist": false,
      "incompatibility_reason": null
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 0,
    "ready": 0,
    "normalizable": 0,
    "incompatible": 0
  }
}
```

The JSON catalog is the primary input for `batch-normalize-and-package`. Keep field names stable.

### Step 7: Deliver Results

Report to the user:

1. Path to the markdown report
2. Path to the JSON catalog
3. One-line summary: "Found N skills across M repos: X ready, Y normalizable, Z incompatible."
4. If any sources were inaccessible, name them explicitly
5. Suggested next action based on counts:
   - If normalizable > 0: "Run `batch-normalize-and-package` on the JSON catalog."
   - If incompatible > 0 and count is small: "Review incompatible skills manually — see the report for reasons."
   - If ready == total: "All skills are Dojo-compatible. Proceed to import."

Clean up temp directories created during the scan (`/tmp/skill-scan/`).

## II. Best Practices

**Scan before you normalize, always.** Running `normalize-community-skill` on every file without a prior scan wastes compute on incompatible files that cannot be fixed by normalization anyway.

**Use `--depth=1` for all clones.** Community skill repos can be large. Full history is irrelevant for a compatibility scan; shallow clones keep the operation fast and disk-efficient.

**Preserve the source path in the catalog.** The `source_path` field in the JSON catalog is what allows `batch-normalize-and-package` to locate the file without re-scanning. Never omit it.

**Pattern-match candidates are noisy.** Files that match the filename heuristic but have no frontmatter should be logged as "not a skill" rather than "incompatible." Incompatible implies the author intended a skill but missed required fields. "Not a skill" means the file was a false positive from the heuristic.

**Percentage breakdowns matter.** A repo with 80% normalizable skills is a good import candidate — one batch run cleans it up. A repo with 80% incompatible is a warning sign about the repo's overall quality or schema assumptions.

**Clean up temp directories.** Every shallow clone takes disk space. Always delete `/tmp/skill-scan/` at the end of the workflow, even on failure.

## III. Quality Checklist

Before delivering the scan results, confirm:

- [ ] All input sources have been processed (accessible ones scanned, inaccessible ones logged)
- [ ] Every candidate file has been classified as exactly one of: ready, normalizable, incompatible
- [ ] No file appears in more than one classification
- [ ] Markdown report exists at the output path and is readable
- [ ] JSON catalog exists at the output path and is valid JSON
- [ ] JSON catalog `summary` counts match the count of skills in the `skills` array
- [ ] `source_path` is populated for every skill entry in the catalog
- [ ] One-line summary has been delivered to the user
- [ ] Temp directories have been deleted
- [ ] If any sources were inaccessible, the user has been told which ones and why

## IV. Related Skills

- `normalize-community-skill` - The per-file normalization skill invoked after this scan identifies "normalizable" candidates
- `batch-normalize-and-package` - Consumes the JSON catalog produced by this skill to run normalization at scale
- `skill-maintenance` - Use after import to rename skills that don't follow verb-object naming conventions
- `health-audit` - Use to audit the Dojo skill ecosystem after a batch import completes

## Output

- `skill-scan-report.md` — human-readable markdown report with summary table, skills inventory, recommendations, and source accessibility log
- `skill-scan-catalog.json` — machine-readable catalog consumed by `batch-normalize-and-package`; includes per-skill classification, missing fields, and body structure signals
- One-line summary delivered to the user: "Found N skills across M repos: X ready, Y normalizable, Z incompatible."
- Temp directories cleaned up (`/tmp/skill-scan/`)

## Examples

**Scenario 1:** "Scan alirezarezvani/claude-skills and tell me which skills we can use" → Clone repo with `--depth=1`, find all SKILL.md files, parse frontmatter and body, classify each as ready/normalizable/incompatible, produce report and catalog, deliver one-line summary with next-step recommendation.

**Scenario 2:** "Before running batch normalization, audit our local plugin directory" → Walk the local path in place (no clone), apply the same two-pass file discovery and classification, write report and catalog to the current directory.

## Edge Cases

- Repository is private or returns 404 — log as inaccessible, skip, continue with other sources; name it explicitly in the accessibility log section of the report
- A file matches the pattern heuristic (contains `skill` in path, has `---` delimiter) but has no actual YAML fields — classify as "not a skill" (false positive), not "incompatible"; incompatible implies the author intended a skill
- Source list is a mix of GitHub URLs and local paths — process each independently and merge results into a single catalog; source type is tracked in the `url` field

## Anti-Patterns

- **Normalizing without scanning first:** Running `normalize-community-skill` on every file before classification wastes compute on files that cannot be salvaged by normalization
- **Treating "incompatible" as "bad knowledge":** The classification is structural, not qualitative — log the reason, preserve the name, and let the operator decide whether to invest in manual repair
- **Omitting `source_path` from the catalog:** Without the source path, `batch-normalize-and-package` cannot locate the file and must re-scan; always populate this field
